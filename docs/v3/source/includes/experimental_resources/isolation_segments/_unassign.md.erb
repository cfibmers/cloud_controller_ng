This endpoint revokes the entitlement for the specified organization to the isolation segment.  Only Admins can revoke isolation segment entitlements.  If the isolation segment is assigned to a space within an organization, the entitlement cannot be revoked.  If the isolation segment is the organization's default, and the organization has more than one isolation segment, the entitlement cannot be revoked.
